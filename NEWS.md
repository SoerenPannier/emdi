# emdi 2.1.0
* Extension of the ebp function to allow informative sampling
* Additional data-driven transformations for the ebp 
* New additional vignette
* Example in write.ods fixed

# emdi 2.0.3
* Robustifying tests to comply with alternative implementations

# emdi 2.0.2

* Structure of S3-classes has been cleaned up
* The bootstrap parameter in the fh-function has been changed from a single number to a single number or a numeric vector with two elements to allow for seperately controlling the number of bootstrap iterations for the MSE estimation and the computation of the bootstrap based information criteria
* Renaming the robustness constant in the fh function
* Minor fixes in the documentation
* Reducing the sizes of the data sets used for test that tests to decrease testing time
