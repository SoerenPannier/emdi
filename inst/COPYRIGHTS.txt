Please note that the data sets in tests/testthat/EBP are modified for our 
purposes. This means for the data set incomedata.RData that we only use the 
provinces that are also contained in the data set Xoutsamp. Furthermore, we 
created a data set called incomedata_woTeruel.RData that does not contain the 
province Teruel. Also the data set Xoutsamp is changed in the sense that 
unnecessary explanatory variables are deleted and a variable with the province 
names is added. The new data set with population data is called 
Xoutsamp_AuxVar.RData.
