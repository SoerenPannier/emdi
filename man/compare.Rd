\usage{
compare(object, ...)

\method{compare}{fh}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of type "fh".}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The return of \code{compare} depends on the class of its argument.
The documentation of particular methods gives detailed information about the
return of that method.

For the method for class "fh", the null hypothesis, the value W of
the test statistic, the degrees of freedom and the p value of the Brown test;
and the correlation coefficient of the synthetic part and the direct
estimator \cite{(Chandra et al. 2015)} are returned.
}
\description{
Function \code{compare} is a generic function used to assess the quality of
the model-based estimates by comparing them with the direct estimates.

Method \code{compare.fh} assesses the quality of the model-based estimates
of the Fay-Herriot model by comparing them with the direct estimates based
on a goodness-of-fit test proposed by \cite{Brown et al. (2001)} and by
computing the correlation between the regression-synthetic part of the
Fay-Herriot model and the direct estimates.
