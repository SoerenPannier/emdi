\arguments{
\item{model}{a model object of type "emdi", either "ebp" or "fh",
representing point and MSE estimates.}

\item{direct}{an object of type "direct","emdi", representing point
and MSE estimates. If the input argument \code{model} is of type "ebp",
\code{direct} is required. If the input argument \code{model} is of type
"fh", the \code{direct} component is already included in the input
argument \code{model}.}

\item{indicator}{optional character vector that selects which indicators
shall be returned: (i) all calculated indicators ("all");
(ii) each indicator name: "Mean", "Quantile_10", "Quantile_25", "Median",
"Quantile_75", "Quantile_90", "Head_Count",
"Poverty_Gap", "Gini", "Quintile_Share" or the function name/s of
"custom_indicator/s"; (iii) groups of indicators: "Quantiles", "Poverty",
"Inequality" or "Custom". If two of these groups are selected, only the first
one is returned. Note, additional custom indicators can be defined as
argument for the EBP approaches (see also \code{\link{ebp}}) and do not
appear in groups of indicators even though these might belong to one of the
groups. If the \code{model} argument is of type "fh", indicator can be set
to "all", "Direct", FH", or "FH_Bench" (if emdi object is overwritten by
function \code{\link{benchmark}}). Defaults to "all".}

\item{MSE}{optional logical. If \code{TRUE}, the MSE estimates of the direct
and model-based estimates are compared via boxplots and scatter plots.}

\item{CV}{optional logical. If \code{TRUE}, the coefficient of variation
estimates of the direct and model-based estimates are compared via boxplots
and scatter plots.}

\item{label}{argument that enables to customize title and axis labels. There
are three options to label the evaluation plots: (i) original labels
("orig"), (ii) axis labels but no title ("no_title"), (iii) neither axis
labels nor title ("blank").}

\item{color}{a vector with two elements. The first color determines
the color for the regression line in the scatter plot and the color for
the direct estimates in the remaining plots. The second color specifies the
color of the intersection line in the scatter plot and the color for the
model-based estimates in the remaining plots. Defaults to
c("blue", "lightblue3").}

\item{shape}{a numeric vector with two elements. The first shape determines
the shape of the points in the scatterplot and the shape of the points for
the direct estimates in the remaining plots. The second shape determines
the shape for the points for the model-based estimates. The options
are numbered from 0 to 25. Defaults to c(16, 16).}

\item{line_type}{a character vector with two elements. The first line type
determines the line type for the regression line in the scatter plot and the
line type for the direct estimates in the remaining plots. The second line
type specifies the line type of the intersection line in the scatter plot and
the line type for the model-based estimates in the remaining plots. The
options are: "twodash", "solid", "longdash", "dotted", "dotdash", "dashed"
and "blank". Defaults to  c("solid", "solid").}

\item{gg_theme}{\code{\link[ggplot2]{theme}} list from package \pkg{ggplot2}.
For using this argument, package \pkg{ggplot2} must be loaded via
\code{library(ggplot2)}. See also Example 2.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
Plots comparing direct and model-based estimators for each selected
indicator obtained by \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}.

A scatter plot and a line plot comparing direct and model-based
estimators for each selected indicator obtained by
\code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}. If the input arguments MSE and CV are set to
TRUE two extra plots are created, respectively: the MSE/CV estimates of the
direct and model-based estimates are compared by boxplots and scatter plots.
}
\description{
Function \code{compare_plot} is a generic function used to produce plots
comparing point and existing MSE/CV estimates of direct and model-based
estimation for all indicators or a selection of indicators.

Methods \code{compare_plot.direct}, \code{compare_plot.ebp} and
\code{compare_plot.fh} produce plots comparing point and existing
MSE/CV estimates of direct and model-based estimation for all indicators or a
selection of indicators for objects of type "emdi". The direct and
model-based point estimates are compared by a scatter plot and a line plot
for each selected indicator. If the input arguments MSE and CV are set to
TRUE, two extra plots are created, respectively: the MSE/CV estimates of the
direct and model-based estimates are compared by boxplots and scatter plots.
}
\details{
Since all of the comparisons need a direct estimator, the plots are
only created for in-sample domains.
