\arguments{
\item{fixed}{a two-sided linear formula object describing the
fixed-effects part of the nested error linear regression model with the
dependent variable on the left of a ~ operator and the explanatory
variables on the right, separated by + operators. The argument corresponds
to the argument \code{fixed} in function \code{\link[nlme]{lme}}.}

\item{pop_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise the variables
named on the right of the ~ operator in \code{fixed}, i.e. the explanatory
variables, and \code{pop_domains}.}

\item{pop_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates domains in the population data. The variable can be numeric or
a factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{smp_domains}.}

\item{smp_data}{a data frame that needs to comprise all variables named in
\code{fixed} and \code{smp_domains}.}

\item{smp_domains}{a character string containing the name of a variable
that indicates domains in the sample data. The variable can be numeric or a
factor but needs to be of the same class as the variable named in
\code{pop_domains}.}

\item{L}{a number determining the number of Monte-Carlo simulations that
must be at least 1. Defaults to 50. For practical applications, values
larger than 200 are recommended (see also
\cite{Molina, I. and Rao, J.N.K. (2010)}).}

\item{threshold}{a number defining a threshold. Alternatively, a threshold
may be defined as a \code{function} of \code{y} returning a numeric value.
Such a function will be evaluated once for the point estimation and in each
iteration of the parametric bootstrap. A threshold is needed for calculation
e.g. of head count ratios and poverty gaps. The  argument defaults to
\code{NULL}. In this case, the threshold is set to 60\% of the median of the
variable that is selected as dependent variable similary to the
at-risk-of-poverty rate used in the EU (see also
\cite{Social Protection  Committee 2001}). However, any desired threshold can
be chosen.}

\item{transformation}{a character string. Five different transformation
types for the dependent variable can be chosen (i) no transformation ("no");
(ii) log transformation ("log"); (iii) Box-Cox transformation ("box.cox");
(iv) Dual transformation ("dual"); (v) Log-Shift transformation
("log.shift"). Defaults to \code{"box.cox"}.}

\item{interval}{a string equal to 'default' or a numeric vector containing a
lower and upper limit determining an interval for the estimation of the
optimal parameter. The interval is passed to function
\code{\link[stats]{optimize}} for the optimization. Defaults to 'default'
which equals c(-1,2) for Box-Cox, c(0,2) for Dual and an interval based on
the range of y for Log-Shift transformation. If the convergence fails, it is
often advisable to choose a smaller more suitable interval. For right skewed
distributions, the negative values may be excluded, also values larger than
1 are seldom observed.}

\item{MSE}{if \code{TRUE}, MSE estimates using a parametric bootstrap
approach are calculated (see also \cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)}).
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{B}{a number determining the number of bootstrap populations in the
parametric bootstrap approach (see also
\cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)}) used in the MSE estimation. The
number must be greater than 1. Defaults to 50. For practical applications,
values larger than 200 are recommended (see also
\cite{Molina, I. and Rao, J.N.K. (2010)}).}

\item{seed}{an integer to set the seed for the random number generator. For
the usage of random number generation, see Details. If seed is set to
\code{NULL}, seed is chosen randomly. Defaults to \code{123}.}

\item{boot_type}{character string to choose between different MSE estimation
procedures,currently a \code{"parametric"} and a semi-parametric
\code{"wild"} bootstrap are possible. Defaults to \code{"parametric"}.}

\item{parallel_mode}{modus of parallelization, defaults to an automatic
selection of a suitable mode, depending on the operating system, if the
number of \code{cpus} is chosen higher than 1. For details, see
\code{\link[parallelMap]{parallelStart}}.}

\item{cpus}{number determining the kernels that are used for the
parallelization. Defaults to 1. For details, see
\code{\link[parallelMap]{parallelStart}}.}

\item{custom_indicator}{a list of functions containing the indicators to be
calculated additionally. Such functions must and must only depend on the
target variable \code{y} and the \code{threshold}.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{na.rm}{if \code{TRUE}, observations with \code{NA} values are deleted
from the population and sample data. For the EBP procedure complete
observations are required. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates weights in the sample data. If a character string is provided
a weighted version of the ebp will be used.The variable has to be numeric.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
An object of class "ebp", "emdi" that provides estimators for
regional disaggregated indicators and optionally corresponding MSE estimates.
Several generic functions have methods for the returned object. For a full

\description{
Function \code{ebp} estimates indicators using the Empirical Best Prediction
approach by \cite{Molina and Rao (2010)}. Point predictions of indicators
are obtained by Monte-Carlo approximations. Additionally, mean squared error
(MSE) estimation can be conducted by using a parametric bootstrap approach
(see also \cite{Gonzalez-Manteiga et al. (2008)}). The unit-level model of
\cite{Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988)} is fitted by the restricted maximum
likelihood (REML) method and one of
five different transformation types for the dependent variable can be chosen.
This approach can be extended to data under informative sampling using
weights and is based on \cite{Guadarrama et al. (2018)}. Model  estimation
combines the uni-level model of \cite{Battese, Harter and Fuller (1988)} and
the approach of \cite{You and Rao (2002)} using survey weights. At the
moment, only the log-transformation is supported for this method.
}
\details{
For Monte-Carlo approximations and in the parametric bootstrap
approach random number generation is used. Thus, a seed is set by the
argument \code{seed}. \cr \cr
The set of predefined indicators includes the mean, median, four further
quantiles (10\%, 25\%, 75\% and 90\%), head count ratio, poverty gap, Gini
coefficient and the quintile share ratio. \cr \cr
Since the sample observations often cannot be identified in practical
applications, a modified approach by Guadarrama et al. (2016) called census
EBP is implemented for the point estimation. For the MSE estimation, the
bootstrap sample is not extracted from the superpopulation, but generated by
the estimated model parameters. The lower the ratio between the sample and
the population size, the closer are the results to the proposed approach by
Molina and Rao (2010).
