\title{A package for estimating and mapping disaggregated indicators}
\description{
The package \pkg{emdi} supports estimating and mapping regional
disaggregated indicators. For estimating these indicators, direct estimation, 
the unit-level Empirical Best Prediction approach by \cite{Molina and Rao (2010)},
the extension for data under informative selection by \cite{Guadarrama et al. (2018)},   
the area-level model by \cite{Fay and Herriot (1979)} and various 
extensions of it (adjusted variance estimation methods, log and arcsin transformation, 
spatial, robust and measurement error models) are provided. Depending on 
the particular method, analytical, bootstrap and jackknife MSE estimation 
approaches are implemented. The assessment of the used model is supported by 
a summary and diagnostic plots. For a suitable presentation of estimates, map 
plots can be easily created. Furthermore, results can easily be exported to 
Excel. Additionally, for the area-level models a stepwise variable selection 
function, benchmarking options and spatial correlation tests are provided.
}
\details{
The three estimation functions are called \code{\link{direct}}, 
\code{\link{ebp}} and \code{\link{fh}}. For all functions, several methods are 
available as \code{\link{estimators.emdi}} and \code{\link{emdi_summaries}}. 
For a full list, please see \code{\link{emdiObject}}. Furthermore, functions 
\code{\link{map_plot}} and \code{\link{write.excel}} help to visualize and 
export results. 
An overview of all currently provided functions can be requested by
\code{library(help=emdi)}.
