\description{
The data set is synthetic EU-SILC data based on the data set
\code{\link[simFrame]{eusilcP}} from package \pkg{simFrame}. The data set is
reduced to 15 variables including a regional variable for the districts and
contains the household level data that is aggregated on the district level.
Therefore, except for the variables \code{ratio_n} and \code{Domain},
the variables are the mean values per district.
