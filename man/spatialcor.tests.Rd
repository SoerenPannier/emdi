\title{Spatial Autocorrelation Tests}
\usage{
spatialcor.tests(direct, corMatrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{direct}{a vector containing direct estimates. The elements of
\code{direct} must be sorted like the elements in \code{corMatrix}.}

\item{corMatrix}{matrix or data frame with dimensions number of areas times
number of areas containing the row-standardized proximities between the
domains. Values must lie between \code{0} and \code{1}. The columns and rows
must be sorted like the domains in \code{direct}.}
}
\value{
The values of the test statistics and their corresponding p values.
}
\description{
This function computes two spatial autocorrelation tests: Moran's I and
Geary's C.
}
\details{
When creating the proximity matrix \code{corMatrix}, please make
sure that the elements of \code{direct} and \code{corMatrix} are sorted
equally and that \code{direct} and \code{corMatrix} do not contain any
\code{NA}s. For a description of how to create the proximity matrix,
see the package vignette "A Framework for Producing Small Area Estimates
Based on Area-Level Models in R". If direct estimates do not exist for every
area contained in the proximity matrix, the proximity matrix needs to be
subsetted to the areas contained in the direct vector.
}
\examples{
# Loading data - sample data and proximity matrix
data("eusilcA_smpAgg")
data("eusilcA_prox")

# Compute spatial correlation tests
spatialcor.tests(
  direct = eusilcA_smpAgg$Mean,
  corMatrix = eusilcA_prox
)
