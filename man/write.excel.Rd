\title{Exports an emdiObject to an Excel File or OpenDocument Spreadsheet}
\usage{
write.excel(
  object,
  file = "excel_output.xlsx",
  indicator = "all",
  MSE = FALSE,
  CV = FALSE,
  split = FALSE
)

write.ods(
  object,
  file = "ods_output.ods",
  indicator = "all",
  MSE = FALSE,
  CV = FALSE,
  split = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of type "emdi", representing point and
MSE estimates.}

\item{file}{path and filename of the spreadsheet to create. It should end on
.xlsx or .ods respectively.}

\item{indicator}{optional character vector that selects which indicators
shall be returned: (i) all calculated indicators ("all");
(ii) each indicator name: "Mean", "Quantile_10", "Quantile_25", "Median",
"Quantile_75", "Quantile_90", "Head_Count",
"Poverty_Gap", "Gini", "Quintile_Share" or the function name/s of
"custom_indicator/s"; (iii) groups of indicators: "Quantiles", "Poverty" or
"Inequality". Note, additional custom indicators can be
defined as argument for model-based approaches (see also \code{\link{ebp}})
and do not appear in groups of indicators even though these might belong to
one of the groups. If the \code{model} argument is of type "fh",
indicator can be set to "all", "Direct", FH", or "FH_Bench" (if emdi
object is overwritten by function benchmark). Defaults to "all".}

\item{MSE}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the MSE of the emdiObject is exported.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{CV}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the CV of the emdiObject is exported.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{split}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, point estimates, MSE and CV are written
to different sheets in the Excel file. In \code{write.ods} \code{TRUE} will
result in different files for point estimates and their precisions.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
An Excel file is created in your working directory, or at the given
path. Alternatively multiple ODS files are created at the given path.
}
\description{
Function \code{write.excel} enables the user to export point and MSE
estimates as well as diagnostics from the \code{summary} to an Excel file.
The user can choose if the results should be reported in one or several Excel
sheets. Furthermore, a selection of indicators can be specified.
Respectively the function \code{write.ods} enables the export to OpenDocument
Spreadsheets. Note that while \code{write.exel} will create a single document
\code{write.ods} will create a group of files.
}
\details{
These functions create an Excel file via the package
\pkg{\link{openxlsx}} and ODS files via the package
\pkg{readODS}.
Both packages require a zip application to be available to \R. If this is not
the case the authors of \pkg{\link{openxlsx}} suggest the first of the
following two ways.
\itemize{
\item Install Rtools from: http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and
modify the system PATH during installation.
\item If Rtools is installed, but no system path variable is set. One can
set such a variable temporarily to \R by a command like:
\code{Sys.setenv("R_ZIPCMD" = "PathToTheRToolsFolder/bin/zip.exe")}.
}
To check if a zip application is available they recommend the command
\code{shell("zip")}.
